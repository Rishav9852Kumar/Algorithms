# Algorithms
It includes all important algorithms of data structure like searching and sortings and Aplications of stacks and queues and there aplications .

1-Operations performed by compiler to process any expression : -
                                                        
                  i>Infix to Postfix conversion.
                 ii>postfix expression evaluation to obtain the result .
                iii>Checking if the symbols are balanced(i.e checking the brackets starting and closure).
2- Searching operations : -
        
               i>Linear Search (using random array as input ).
              ii>Binary Search (using sorted array as input ).
3- Sorting Algorithms : -
            
            i>Bubble Sort
            ii>Insertion Sort
            iii>Selection Sort
            iv>Merge Sort
            v>Heap Sort
            vi>Quick Sort
            vii>Count sort
            viii>Shell Sort
            ix>Raddix/Bucket Sort
