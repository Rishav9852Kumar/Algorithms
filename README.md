It includes all important algorithms of data structure like searching and sortings and Aplications of stacks and queues and there aplications .
1-Operations performed by compiler to process any expression : -
                                                         i>Infix to Postfix conversion.
                                                         ii>postfix expression evaluation to obtain the result .
                                                         iii>Checking if the symbols are balanced(i.e checking the brackets starting and closure).
